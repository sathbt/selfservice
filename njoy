Why Multifamily Real Estate Investment?
You have many options to invest and grow your hard-earned money. Most of the options will make a decent return over time but they come with high risk or with lots of hassle.
•	Passive investment
Passive investment through multifamily real estate is the best investment for busy professionals and Tech executives. It’s the only investment where your capital is protected by the underlying real estate asset and also gives you cash flow, appreciation, equity, and tax benefits, all without the hassles of being a landlord, so you can focus on what matters most to you.

Income Generation / Cash Flow
 
Hassle-free Passive Income Stream
 
Appreciation – Property Appreciates in Value Over Time
 
Recession Proof Asset Class
 
Tax Benefits - Depreciation is a tax write-off that enables you to keep more of your profits
 
Leverage - You can leverage real estate, this allows you to buy $100M with only $25M.
 
Stability – Less volatile and continues to outperform the S&P 500
Multifamily Real Estate Investment Opportunities
Multifamily Real Estate has shown to be resilient to much of the market fluctuations and can have significant tax advantages.


Historically multifamily has been the least volatile real estate asset class during downturns while still offering strong upside potential during upcycles.


Within multifamily, Class B & C provides one of the most attractive investment opportunities due to the imbalance between the strong and growing demand and limited new supply of these units.

How it works?

Get In Touch To Generate Passive Income
Passive investment
As a passive investor in a multifamily syndication, you purchase units in the syndication company to become a passive limited partner (LP) receiving profit and capital distributions. The direct investment into the syndication company will go towards purchasing the investment property. And that is where the work ends for a passive investment. Now you can sit back and eNjoy the passive returns on your investment.
InvestNJoy Capital and its group of companies do the rest of the work for you. The “General Partnership Team” or “Deal Sponsorship Team” will typically take a small fee of the monthly gross revenue to execute the business plan / renovations and manage the asset as well as a split of the profits. The typical profit split aligns both the Limited Partners or LPs and the General Partners or GPs interest to make the project as fruitful as possible benefiting all as the investor returns increase.
Some of the common benefits from a passive investment include periodic distributions from cash flow, appreciation of the asset realized at sale, and potential tax savings through depreciation. You will also receive investor updates and reports including financial and the status of the operations and renovations. And that is how we at InvestNjoy Capital work to help you Invest and eNjoy passive income through real estate investments.
